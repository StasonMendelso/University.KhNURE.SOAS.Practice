### Installation Instruction

#### How to download project on my local machine?

For downloading the project locally you can use two variants:

1. Download the ZIP archive from the repository page.

   The method is easy, the next steps helps you:
    1. Find the button `Code` and press it.
    2. Find the button `Download ZIP` and press it. The downloading must start.
    3. Unzip the archive in soe directory and run the IDEA in this directory.

Project has been installed.

2. Use the `Git` for downloading the repository locally.

   The method a lit bit difficult, but the project will be downloaded with the help
   of several commands, and not manually, as in the previous method. For this method
   you **need** to [install][4] the `Git Bash` on your computer, make some configuration and have a primary skill of
   using this system of version control.
    1. Enter your [name][5], [email][6] of GitHub account locally on your machine.
    2. Create an empty directory and initialize it as git repository. Use the next
       command - `git init`.
    3. Adds this repository to yours with name `origin` (you can change it, if you want):
        ```
       $ git remote add origin git@github.com:StasonMendelso/University.KhNURE.SOAS.Practice.git
       ```
       But you need configure your SSH connection to your GitHub profile in Git Bash. See more [here][7].

       For viewing that the repository has been added successfully to your local
       repository, you need execute the next command:
       ```
       $ git remote -v
       ```

       After this step your local repository has got a 'connection' to the remote
       project from the GitHub repository.
    4. For downloading the project use the following command:
       ```
       $ git pull origin main
       ```
       After these steps your project directory must contain the project files from
       GitHub repository. In addition to, you can create a new branch, make some
       changes and create a pull request for suggesting your improvements. Also, all
       changes are observed by the `git` and you can always make a rollback of
       all changes `git reset --hard`.
